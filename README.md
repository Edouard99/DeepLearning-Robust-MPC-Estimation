# DeepLearning-Robust-MPC-Estimation

Hi ! :wave:

Sorry for the mess in this project's code and readMe! I am currently cleaning the project's code and building :construction_worker: the readMe! It will be soon updated, yet you can still have a look at the code and at the <a href='./Project Report.pdf'>report</a> that summarizes all the theory and workflow. :smiley:

The objective of this project is to use a Deep Learning model to estimate an MPC (Method Predictive Control) control law. Using a neural network to estimate the control law reduces the computational cost required. Yet, one problem is that the model will only give an estimation of the ideal control law. To ensure the respect of the constraints and the stability of the system, the Deep Learning model estimates the law of a Robust MPC controller (implemented in Matlab).

Wait for the update ...  :hourglass:
