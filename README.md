# DeepLearning-Robust-MPC-Estimation

Hi ! :wave:

Sorry for the mess in this project's code and readMe! I am currently cleaning the project's code and building :construction_worker: the readMe! It will be soon updated, yet you can still have a look at the code and at the <a href='./Project Report.pdf'>report</a> that summarizes all the theory and workflow. :smiley:

This project aims to estimate a robust MPC optimization using a Deep Learning model.

Wait for the update ...  :hourglass:
